# Electro Sounds - Fake World

A project by Emmeline Koh. Done using p5.js for Semester 2's Electro-Sounds Project Code.


## Project Description

The Fake World is a coding project done by Emmeline Koh. It is meant to be a world where one can lose themselves in, and escape from reality, yet while knowing it is still only a fabricated world, thus explaining the overall colourful, jittery, "plastic" aesthetic. Some of the elements are meant to be recognised and yet out of place, making it feel familiar and yet strange at the same time. This was done to highlight the virtual aspect of this world, that it cannot be real. It combines both audio reactive and user interactive components - certain elements are reactive to certain frequencies, and certain keys and the mousepad can be used to interact with the sketch. Due to these functions, the final sketch is suitable for use as visuals accompanying live performance, with the option of having someone to "play" the sketch, or leave it as a self-playing sketch.


## Reflection

This has been a tough journey for me because it was difficult for me to pick up coding quickly. However, thanks to the help of my lecturer and classmates, as well as online resources, I was able to find some enjoyment while working on the sketch and bringing it to fruition. The "GettingStartedwithP5js" pdf book was also a great help. With a lot of self studying, I managed to understand more complicated functions such as arrays and objects. It was not easy but I had to keep reminding myself of the end goal and keep working to get to it. It got a lot more interesting and fun also when I began to understand coding language better. At this point, I look back at my very first sketch and I feel proud that I got this far, even if I do still have a long way to go. Being frustrated and stressed made me beat myself up at some points, but I realise that I need to recognise that I have made some progress, and keep going. I am now equipped with certain skills that I did not have prior to this module and I am thankful for that. This has also taught me that to want to keep learning is a very important trait to have, possibly more important than the immediate results. It is still difficult for me, being a very impatient person, but I am enjoying the process more now. I have gained not just a technical skill but skills that I will be able to use even outside of coding.

## Getting Started

- Ensure that your mic is allowed to be used when sketch is first loaded

- Click ONCE on the sketch to turn on audio reactive functions

- Fake World will be in default mode at the beginning of the sketch

- Press Number Keys 1-4 to cycle through the different moving camera angles from which the Fake World can be viewed from. Any key can be used to stop the camera from moving at any time, and camera will stop at the position it was at when key was pressed. Press Letter Key "R"/"r" to return back to the default state of the sketch.

- Click and drag the trackpad to move anywhere throughout the sketch. The zoom in and out functions on the trackpad also allow for the sketch to be zoomed in and out of. For best results, use this when camera is not moving.

- Press Letter Key "F"/"f" to activate full screen mode. Subsequently, press ESC Key to exit full screen mode.

- Works best with any music that has a lot of dynamics
